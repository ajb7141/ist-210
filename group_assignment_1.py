Music - How many people are listening/genre/amount of plays

For our music idea, we are going to analyze the spotify database and understand who is the most popular artist and why. Our idea is unique in the fact that all of our information is going to stem from the Spotify and Apple Music databases. These databases are relatively new and have a strong base in terms of following. Spotify also stores information based on how many people have listened to the songs and if you wanted you could also correlate the amount of listeners to how much the musicians are making. We would be comparing and looking at all of the genres and how many people are listening to each one respectively. If you were making this into a business, a normal day would look like observing what music people are listening to and putting them into genres, albums, and playlists so users could enjoy. One business transaction that would be help would be to purchase "premium" or "plus" status within the application and for that we would need a name, phone-number, and address, so those could all be "transactions" that could be recorded for future use. Our main goal is to appeal to customers to make sure they like the music that is recommended to them, then offer a premium service that would get rid of ads and give you infinite skips and choice to pick and choose your own albums. This has been done before but what we would do differently is actively try to find music that the user would enjoy and display that for them every time they used the app.

Game Store - Game Name, Price, Genre, Console, ESRB Rating, release date 

For our game store idea, we want to create a database for videogames being sold by a game store. We are interested in understanding the features and attributes of games that people want. Our idea is unique because it takes previously known data about video game products and adds further details about products to help consumers learn about the item they are interested in. This database would be based on information already known from game stores like "GameStop" but further qualifies and identifies different products to inform consumers about the products. When purchasing a game, a typical consumer would most likely want to know about the product they are purchasing. A consumer would most likely want to know information such as the rating, price, genre, etc. to help them make an informed purchase of a game. Our tables in the database would include game name, price, genre, console, and ESRB rating. Under game name we would include the current most popular selling titles. Under price we would include the prices of varying games being sold, being that certain games cost more or less based on condition or since release date. In genre, we would include popular game genres such as first person shooter, adventure, horror, single player/multiplayer, etc. Then for console we would include the consoles that the game is available for such as Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, PC, etc. Lastly for rating, we would include the ESRB rating of the game, such as E, T, and M. Our goal of this database is to help customers make an informed decision about purhcasing a game based on the information given in our tables (Game name, price, genre, console, ESRB rating).

Car dealership - The idea is to create a database for all cars sold by a used car dealership in State College. We are trying to understand the features that customers are interested in. Our idea will expand to understand the buyerâ€™s purchasing decision behavior, so the business become more profitable and efficient. The database can be analyzed for marketing purposes; for example, advertisements can be direct to the targeted demographic. Also, the data can be beneficial for developing more profitable models in the future. What makes our data unique that it is collected at a micro-level by the car dealer instead of the manufacture which gives it the advantage of recording detailed data such as how many times the customer visited before making the final purchase. Car dealerships usually open from 9 am to 7 or 9 pm, and customer walk shopping for cars available. Some customer shop for cars online before coming to the deal to inspect the car. Once the customer selects a car, the salesman will explain the financing options to finalize the deal by signing paperwork.  All in all, the data will give a better understanding of used car dealership business. Here are someof the data that can be collected: 1) count of cars sold 2) make 3) model 4) color 5) new or used 6) customer a) age b) gender c) ethnicity 7) size 8) how long it took the car to be sold. 9) deal sittings (what day the car was sold, and what time of the year) 10) salesman 11) payment method.
